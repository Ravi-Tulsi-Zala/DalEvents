## Framework

-   MEAN Stack

    -   MongoDb (Database)
        - This is the database used to store all of our data.

    -   Express (Back-end)
        - This is used to retrieve data from the database and return them in a usable format.

    -   Angular
        - This framework is used for running our web application.

    -   Node.js
        - This is used to run Express and download any dependencies.


## Feature

**Event Details Page**

-   For this page, I wanted to get the data from backend for a particular event.

-   I also wanted data for the cards that would show at the bottom of the EventDetails page

-   Clicking on a card will take you to its event


**Events Data**

-   All of the data within our database were pulled from Dalhousie Events Page [link](https://www.dal.ca/news/events.html)


## Event Model

    {  
    "eventId": 114,  
    "imageUrl": "unknown",  
    "title": "ONE WORLD SYMPOSIUMtest",  
    "description": "This FREE symposium is an opportunity for people to learn about how local actions can make an impact on a global scale. Centered around refugee stories and experiences, attendees will learn from a keynote speaker, story tellers from our human library, and participate in a forced migration simulation. Everything will take place on March 23rd from 12-5PM in the Kenneth Rowe Building at Dalhousie University. Coffee, tea, and snacks will be provided. Come to learn new experiences and expand your perspectives of the world! #OneWorld4Change /n An evening social with music will be held afterwards at 7PM (location TBA). ",

## What is currently in Development

-   Some of the cards will not be the same size because of the different resolutions of the image. This should be corrected before the final demo of the project.

-   The date in the Event Details Page are inconsistent. As a group, we are working on how the data will be represented in the database. It is an iterative process and we should have a better version before the final demo of the project

## W3C Compliance Check
I only worked on the Event Details' component HTML. The header and footer are similar for all pages and are compliant. The Event Details's component HTML will throw errors on "*ngIf" ,"*ngFor", and service variables:{{eventdetails[0].firstname}} in terms of compliance. Any other HTML within the component is compliant. The css file is compliant.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone Repo from [here](https://git.cs.dal.ca/jelliott/daleventsproject) within command prompt: **git clone [https://git.cs.dal.ca/jelliott/daleventsproject.git](https://git.cs.dal.ca/jelliott/daleventsproject.git)**

2.  Checkout out feature/eventDetails : **git checkout feature/eventDetails**
3.  Make sure that you have the latest code : **git pull**
4.  Install all dependencies from the root folder: **npm install**
5.  Install Angular : **npm install -g @angular/cli**


**Connecting to Back-end Server**

6.  Go into the back-end folder : **cd backend**

7.  Install all dependencies from the back-end folder: **npm install**

8.  Within the back-end folder, run the server : **node server.js**


**Running the Front-end**

9.  Open a New File Explorer to the root of the project.

10.  The back-end server should be running from step 7; now you can run the application, from the root of the project.

11.  Open a command prompt from the root of the project and type: **ng serve -o**

12.  The browser should open up to `http://localhost:4200/`
